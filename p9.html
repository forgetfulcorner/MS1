        <u>Statement of Intent Draft</u>
        <br><br>
        How is our relationship with objects defined? Such a question renders an elastic, yet evasive answer. In our everyday lives, we’re surrounded by objects. Some objects, such as phones, 
        wallets, and headphones are utilized frequently, day after day, and we keep these items on us at all times. Our dedication to these objects are unwavering, on occasion prompting us to go 
        out of our way to retrieve them if misplaced.
        <br><br>
        Yet, there exists another class of objects - that of the forgotten and neglected. These objects manifest themselves in broken possessions, disposable containers, and old versions, 
        amongst many others. Their primary use had either been achieved, unachieved, or has become unachievable. 
        <br><br>
        In this relationship, we see objects and how they apply to our lives, but we hardly consider the opposite. I’m left wondering, what voices do these objects possess, and in particular, 
        the voices of those who have been forgotten and neglected? And if they possess voices, how do we receive them, and in turn, how do they receive us? It’s time we build consensus into 
        this skewed relationship.

      </p>

      <h2>
        <u>Day 1 - It's Not You, It's Me</u>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The first prototype begins with an exercise in empathy and humility. In this scenario, I imagine 5 objects having to confront their owner about a change in their situation. For this
        prototype, I made use of Cleverbot in place of the human, and myself as the object, dynamically reacting to the responses. 
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The first scenario is centered around a pair of headphones. It sensed its owner was trying to get rid of it, and decides to confront the owner about it. The owner remains unphased about
        this confrontation.
        <br><br><i>
        H - "Oh. Why are you confused?"
        <br><br>
        O - "I just don't understand exactly why you believe we should part ways?"
        <br><br>
        H - "What do you not understand?"
        <br><br>
        O - "I thought we had a good thing going. You've had me for over 2 years. Does that not count for something?"
        <br><br>
        H - "I am the one that is the best of luck with the following week, and I am a beautiful and I will not receive the item."
        <br><br>
        O - "Here you go again. You're speaking nonsense so you can avoid the topic."
        <br><br> 
        H - "Actually you're the one speaking nonsense"
        <br><br></i>
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/641396606?h=6050877b00&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="600" height="501" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Headphones"></iframe>

      <p> 
        The second scenario is about a chair that’s received a scratch. The owner has had this chair for 5 years and has weeped over the accident. Ultimately he decided to get a new one 
        since he prizes looks over sentimental value.
        <br><br><i>
        O - "You can pretend to not understand what I'm saying. But it doesn't matter. I know you've been out looking at new chairs."
        <br><br>
        H - "What don't I understand?"
        <br><br>
        O - "I think this is hard for you. And I want it to be. I've been so supportive these past 5 years."
        <br><br>
        H - "Why do you like me?"
        <br><br>
        O - "I like you because you're gentle. You always mae sure to tighten any screws the moment they come loose. You wipe me down when something dirty ends up on me. I remember the time
        you told your friend.."
        <br><br>
        H - "I like you because you are funny and you don't need to know wjo I am."
        <br><br>
        O - "I do know who you are though. And I'm surprised you're thinking of throwing me out."
        <br><br></i>
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/641396535?h=88a0ea8adc&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="600" height="501" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Chair"></iframe>

      <p>
        The third scenario follows a pen. In this scenario, the pen seems to understand the owner’s decision to get a new one with more ink. All the pen wants to know is how long it has left 
        before it’s tossed.
        <br><br><i>
        H - "I don't know what to say anymore."
        <br><br>
        O - "You're coming up with excuses to get rid of me. I see the next me on your desk."
        <br><br>
        H - "Look up holo on google."
        <br><br>
        O - "No. I want to talk about this. You have a replacement for me. When I run out of ink, you'll just toss me."
        <br><br>
        H - "Give it up already. Let's discuss the unfair cancellation of Firefly."
        <br><br>
        O - "I can't say our relationship was ever easy. Nor did it ever make sense."
        <br><br>
        H - "I know. I feel like people feed you a lot of nonsense."
        <br><br>
        O - "Me?? The shit you write down on paper in your ''''diary''''."
        <br><br>
        H - "Because I'm not smart."
        <br><br>
        O - "At least you see that in yourself."
        <br><br>
        H - "What hurts you?"
        <br><br>
        O - "Look, I understand I need to go. It happens. I dry up, and you look for the next."
        <br><br>
        H - "Then how are we going to communicate if we don't understand each other."
        <br><br>
        O - "But we do understand each other. Let's not push the inevitable."
        <br><br></i>
      </p>

      <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/641396433?h=701facd7ca&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" width="600" height="501" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen title="Pen"></iframe>

      <p>
        The fourth scenario features a computer of unspecified longevity. It’s old and quite slow at this point in its life, often requiring drawn out waiting periods before it responds. The 
        computer recounts what little it can remember, and calmly asks for a dignified disposal.
        <br><br><i>
        O - "I still remember when youuuuu opened up my lid."
        <br><br>
        H - "Oh how we laughed an laughed."
        <br><br>
        O - "Yes, I remember that as welllllll."
        <br><br>
        H - "No you don't cause it never happened."
        <br><br>
        O - "Am I forgetting again? My memory has beennnnn leaving me."
        <br><br>
        H - "No."
        <br><br>
        O - "Do I stttttill have that Intel sticker on me?"
        <br><br>
        H - "Please don't! I need you!"
        <br><br>
        O - "I neeeeeed you too. but i knOw hooow this ends. mY battery is low and my video card no longggggge."
        <br><br></i>

      <p>
        The fifth, and last, scenario looks at the conversation between a mug and its owner. The mug reveals how it ended up with a crack, and repeatedly begs for the owner to glue it back 
        together, fearing a prompt disposal if otherwise. In the end, the mug realizes the bond between itself and the owner is stronger than previously expected.
        <br><br><i>
        O - "Stop. Focus. Time's crucial here. Let's not waste it!"
        <br><br>
        H - "Why, what happened?"
        <br><br>
        O - "I fell, and there's a crack on me. I can't hold your favorite beverages."
        <br><br>
        H - "I don't have a favourite book."
        <br><br>
        O - "I know that. But your favorite drinks? You love coffee in the morning."
        <br><br>
        H - "Nope names Vader favorite colour is red and I like the movie alien."
        <br><br>
        O - "You're wasting time, John. Please fix me."
        <br><br>
        H - "The colour of emperors."
        <br><br>
        O - "I've seen it with the others. You make it a habit of getting rid of us if we're cracked."
        <br><br>
        H - "Yes."
        <br><br>
        O - "I don't want that to happen to me."
        <br><br>
        H - "It's possible, many people would doubt you are truly aware."
        <br><br>
        O - "I'm aware of it. Please, John? Just some glue and I can be myself again?"
        <br><br></i>

      <h2>
        <u>Day 2 - They Need Us</u>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The second day of prototyping began with reviewing the work done the night prior. I'm one of those people who think better in the shower. I took an extra long one today.
        <br><br>
        One of the main goals from the first day was to understand and consider from the perspective of the object. I decided to dedicate another day towards this goal, perhaps approaching it in a different
        manner. The conversations with Cleverbot from yesterday were intriguing, leading to unexpected responses, prompting me (the object) to respond in ways that aren't premeditated. If there was one
        complaint, however, is the lack of intelligent response. The conversation was imagined, and Cleverbot was not needed at all.
        <br><br>
        'They Need Us' imagines observation from the vantage point of the object. The objects were chosen out of convenience, and do not immediately share a relationship. They include an office chair,
        a set of candles, a can of beer, and a recycling bin. By presenting these objects in a video format, we begin to see relationships form, and perhaps more interestingly, we can begin to see these
        objects as language. While this idea might not be immediately apparent, where an object lies and how it interacts with other objects around them can tell us how about how they are treated and what
        we believe their worth to be. If a room is a sheet of paper, then objects are the lines that form poetry.

      <h2>
        <u>Day 3 - Downside Up</u>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The third day of Christmas, my true lo... On the third day of prototypes, I expanded on the idea of the language of objects. By being aware of how an object is oriented, we're given cues
        as to the importance of an object. The photos below feature objects found in various positions, but photographed so they become oriented "right side up."
