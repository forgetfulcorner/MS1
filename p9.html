        <u>Statement of Intent Draft</u>
        <br><br>
        How is our relationship with objects defined? Such a question renders an elastic, yet evasive answer. In our everyday lives, we’re surrounded by objects. Some objects, such as phones, 
        wallets, and headphones are utilized frequently, day after day, and we keep these items on us at all times. Our dedication to these objects are unwavering, on occasion prompting us to go 
        out of our way to retrieve them if misplaced.
        <br><br>
        Yet, there exists another class of objects - that of the forgotten and neglected. These objects manifest themselves in broken possessions, disposable containers, and old versions, 
        amongst many others. Their primary use had either been achieved, unachieved, or has become unachievable. 
        <br><br>
        In this relationship, we see objects and how they apply to our lives, but we hardly consider the opposite. I’m left wondering, what voices do these objects possess, and in particular, 
        the voices of those who have been forgotten and neglected? And if they possess voices, how do we receive them, and in turn, how do they receive us? It’s time we build consensus into 
        this skewed relationship.

      <h2>
        <u>Day 1 - It's Not You, It's Me</u>
      </h2>

      <p>
        The first prototype begins with an exercise in empathy and humility. In this scenario, I imagine 5 objects having to confront their owner about a change in their situation.
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The first scenario is centered around a pair of headphones. It sensed its owner was trying to get rid of it, and decides to confront the owner about it.
        <br><br><br>
      </p>

      <p> 
        The second scenario is about a chair that’s received a scratch. The owner has had this chair for 5 years and has weeped over the accident. Ultimately he decided to get a new one 
        since he prizes looks over sentimental value.
        <br><br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The third scenario follows a pen. In this scenario, the pen seems to understand the owner’s decision to get a new one with more ink. All the pen wants to know is how long it has left 
        before it’s tossed.
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The fourth scenario features a computer of unspecified longevity. It’s old and quite slow at this point in its life, often requiring drawn out waiting periods before it responds. The 
        computer recounts what little it can remember, and calmly asks for a dignified disposal.
        <br><br>
      </p>

      <p>
        The fifth, and last, scenario looks at the conversation between a mug and its owner. The mug reveals how it ended up with a crack, and repeatedly begs for the owner to glue it back 
        together, fearing a prompt disposal if otherwise. In the end, the mug realizes the bond between itself and the owner is stronger than previously expected.
      </p>
