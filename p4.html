      <h3>
        <u>Research Questions</u>
      </h3>

      <p>
        <br>
        From the interests above, I explored questions I'd be interested in investigating further. Most of these questions are focused around Humans, which I later reflected upon as the central 
        thread between the disparate interests. While the inquisitory is around Humans and the "soft" parts of our being, the other topics serve as potential vessels through which the inquiry 
        channels its findings. A couple of questions were chosen to explore further by investigating the data associated with it (**).
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>In a world engrossed in darkness, what are we able to gather around us? **<br><br>
        Is it possible for two people to be feeling the exact same emotion?<br><br>
        What physical aspects of ourselves can we transfer into a digital realm? **<br><br>
        How do we determine the value of something?<br><br></i>

    <h3>
      <u>Observations</u>
    </h3>

        To begin thinking about this question, I decided to track how time and duration are affected by the lack of sight. The idea is to draw a straight line from point A to point B to the closest
        of my ability within the given amount of time. This involves pacing, an understanding of where our pen currently is on the paper, and it relies on the motor skills to manifest these
        interpretations. 
        <br>
      </p>

    <p>
      Within a 1 minute time frame, lines were relatively straight and uniform. As we look at the 2 minute time frames, the line begins to waver, although directionality isn't entirely affected.
      Lastly, for the longest duration, the mind found it difficult to find the target, resulting in an undershooting on the first pass, and an overshooting during the second. A short test
      at a 1 minute time frame after the successive 4 minute frames resulted in an overshot line, but generally true in direction. 
      <br><br>
      As part of this observation, I included material swatches of varying textures that intend to be touched and observed for sounds without the use of vision.

        For the second question, I tracked objects within my immediate vicinity. This included objects both "desirable" and "undesirable", both meaningful and meaningless. For each of these items,
        I took inventory of how much of each were in the room, and I plotted this information onto translucent trace paper. Each subsequent quantity is represented by redrawing the object onto the
        sheet above.

      While this was an exercise in counting, the physical representation of objects fading away can help us appreciate qualatative differences in a tangible way. For me, this chart had an inverse
      association. The items I had most of, mostly pens and junk mail, also carried the least amount of meaning. One can imagine if this exercise were shown to a collector. He might find a different
      association between quantity and meaning. For him, this might even help him understand which particular aspect of his collection he relates most to.
      <br>
      <br>
      After discussions and consideration for scope, the research questions have expanded into the following.
      <br>
      <br>
      <i>
      What would go in a sensory toolkit for navigating in the dark?<br><br>
      How do we instill value into something foreign to us?<br><br>
      How can a user transform an object so that it gains value?<br><br>
      How do you share an emotion without the use of senses?<br><br>
      How can we connect with someone or something from another time?<br><br>
      </i>
