        Site Selection

      <h3><br>
        Site Location & Enviroment Analysis
      </h3>

      <p>
        The elliptical plot of land defined by the intersection of Flatbush Ave, Plaza St W, 
        and Vanderbilt Ave is known as Grand Army Plaza. On all sides, the plaza is surrounded 
        by 4 lanes of roundabout traffic, but offers a couple of access points for pedestrians 
        to the north and to the south. Ultimately, this plaza leads into the larger Prospect Park, 
        and serves as an open forum space, allowing for the occurrence of markets and impromptu 
        large gatherings. 
        
        <br><br>Our reason for selecting this site as the basis for our intervention is due to three factors.
        
        <br><br> &emsp; 1. The site acts as an island of sorts, separated from the larger context by roadways 
        and heavy vehicular traffic. This is interesting because of the participatory nature 
        of the pedestrians who enter the plaza - it takes effort for them to venture across.
        
        <br><br> &emsp; 2. In addition, the site benefits from its proximity to the entrance of Prospect Park 
        and the Grand Army Plaza subway stop, effectively creating a thoroughfare between the two. 
        Not only is the plaza participatory by pedestrians, it's also considered essential.
        
        <br><br> &emsp; 3. The entrance to Prospect Park plays host to various events throughout the year and 
        becomes a dynamic element that tends to spill traffic over onto the Plaza.

        Site History
      </h3>
      
      <p>
        <b>Grand Army Plaza </b> was initially conceived in 1866 as “The Plaza,” the decorated 
        entrance to the (then newly planned) Prospect Park which sought to distance visitors 
        from the chaos of the city beyond. The constituent parts of the Plaza as we recognize 
        them today came subsequently, with the Soldiers and Sailers Memorial Arch in 1892, the 
        Four Columns in 1896, the Bailey Fountain in 1932, and the bust of John F Kennedy in 1965. 
        Early on, during the inception of the plaza,  thoroughfares surrounding the park were utilized 
        primarily by trolleys. It was only with the advent of the automobile did traffic become a serious 
        problem, even prompting a site specific “death-o-meter” which tracked traffic fatalities across 
        Brooklyn. Although the site has received mixed reviews throughout its time, it was eventually 
        designated an official city landmark in 1975, effectively preserving all the aspects of 
        the plaza we see today.

        AEIOU
      </h3>

      <p>
        We took careful observation of people's behavior and interaction with their surrounding 
        areas in the Grand Army Plaza. We noticed that the major two activities happening through 
        the Grand Army Plaza are going across the plaza and taking pictures in the plaza. We evaluate 
        how those users interact with one another and their interactions based on different environmental 
        elements. In the end, we outlined the AEIOU form below to summarize the interaction between people 
        with people, people with objects, and object with object.

      <p>
        In addition to summarizing people’s interactions and behavior, we also recorded the 
        type of users that appear throughout the observation time. The list  consists of readers, 
        seniors, tourists/visitors, dog walkers, moms with strollers and babies, couples, 
        trainers/runners/joggers, bikers, and family groups. There is a diverse combination of demographics 
        within the area, and we are happy to see how we can design our interactive objects to incorporate 
        most types of users in the future.

        Intervetions List & Consideration
      </h3>

      <p>

        Based on the interaction we observed and the environmental information we gained, we 
        brainstormed different kinds of interactable activities based on three major categories. 
        They are improving the existing experience, mimicking something from different time/location, 
        and exaggerating the current environment elements/objects. Here are a list of ideas we formed:
        
        <br><br>1. Inflatable object 
        <li> &emsp; a. Cooperation required for strangers to inflate a giant object</li>
        <li> &emsp; b. Novel design on inflatable item to capture users’ attention</li>

        <li><br>2. Podium</li> 
        <li> &emsp; a. Different location & heights to see users’ reaction and interactiont</li>
        <li> &emsp; b. Interactable lighting when users step on it</li>
        <li> &emsp; c. Interactable lighting when users step on it</li>

        <li><br>3. Interactable picturing experience</li>
        <li> &emsp; a. User customizable filter with painting brush in public on an acrylic board </li>
        <li> &emsp; b. Different angle of see-through acrylic board</li>
        <li> &emsp; c. Pre-style see-through acrylic board</li>
        <li> &emsp; d. Mirror to provide a immersive experience</li>

        <li><br>4. Lighting equipments</li>
        <li> &emsp; a. Staging spot light on sculpture to create different theatrical vibe from daylight</li>
        <li> &emsp; b. Projector on the historical sculpture to bring the statue alive</li>

      </p>

      <h3><br>
        Intervetions Choice
      </h3>

      <p>

        Instead of choosing one of the ideas from all of those, we decided to combine the inflatable 
        object and the interactive picturing experience together. Since Grand Army Plaza is a giant 
        oval-shaped park, it is really hard for people to visualize everything through a single glimpse and 
        even harder to include all the beautiful historical architectures in one take. As a result, we 
        wish to be able to bring the most symbolic objects around the park into a centralized area and give 
        users the ability to build things up by themselves. 
        
        <br><br>In detail, we picture an inflatable object on the ground which has been pre-shaped into 
        the arch and columns found throughout the plaza. They will be situated across the cobblestones 
        surrounding the centrally located fountain. To facilitate inflation, we’ll provide tools that 
        blow air so that users can utilize these to bring 2-dimensional shapes into 3-dimensional objects. 
        If the inflatable object is especially large, it may require cooperation between multiple users with 
        air flow tools to reveal the final product. After the objects have been inflated, it will retain its 
        form until the air is slowly depleted. Users will be able to take photos with these inflated objects 
        and fully capture the fabulous plaza objects in a single frame. The objects eventually lose their air 
        (and form) and return to being 2D shapes on the ground, patiently awaiting the next curious crowd.

        Summary
      </h1>

      <p>

        Grand Army Plaza was designed in 1866 as a passing entrance to Prospect Park, and it has 
        remained just that. Users, or more adequately recognized, passersby, spend little time in the 
        plaza despite it being a destination for the neighborhood, and wider yet, the borough. Its vast 
        grounds, imagined for large gatherings and places for interaction have remained barren, devoid 
        of happenings. The parks commission noted in 1888 “It is suggestive of Siberia in winter and 
        Sahara in the summer."
        
        <br><br>Through our observations, we believe we might find some success in taking the 
        opposite approach to how the plaza was designed. By bringing all elements and features of 
        the plaza together, they’re experienced more readily as a group, and not as a series of signifiers 
        guiding one towards Prospect Park. We hope our intervention will be enticing enough to give pause 
        to those who might otherwise pass through the plaza, and enticing enough to those who stay, to 
        stay just a slight moment longer.
